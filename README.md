### discourse-tagging

This plugin provides tagging functionality to Discourse. When users create
topics they can optionally attach tags.

Tags are a useful alternative to categories for some forums. For example
if you were running a music forum, being able to tag a topic as
"Hip Hop" and "Electronica" would be useful. If you were using categories
you'd have to choose one or the other.
